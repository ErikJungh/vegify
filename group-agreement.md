# Group agreement
This is a group agreement for the members of Vegify-2/trEat. This document contains how different situations should be handled. 
## Division of responsibilities
The group is divided into two teams, backend and frontend. The different teams are going to be responsible of different parts of the product. The roles are not static.
We want our team members to be able to switch between several roles if needed or interested.
We will evaluate the roles throughout the project to see if we want to make any changes.
It is also possible for any team member to express their need for change at any time. 

### Backend
*The backend team have the following responsibilities:*
- administrating the server
- construct an API for the frontend team to use in the client
- constructing a database
- communicating with external APIs

*Members of the backend team:*
- Leonora Stiernborg 
- Fredrik Yngve
- August Bredberg 

### Frontend
*The frontend team have the following responsibilities:*
- Creating an app that runs on Android, iOS and in the web-browser
- Encrypting the data sent to the server?

*Members of the frontend team:*
- Erik Junghahn
- Robert Paananen
- Petter Jerndal

If one team struggles to keep up with the other team and either front-end or back-end proves to have a heavier workload than the other. Members from either group can assist the other team to ease the workload.

## Communication and collaboration tools
The main form of communication is going to be via Discord. Both online meetings and everyday textbased communication is going to be via Discord.

## Format of work, planning, and decisions
The team is going to be divided into two teams that are going to work separately but have close communications throughout the process. Whenever a developer gets stuck they will be able to ask for help from their team members.

Each monday the whole team is going to have a weekly meeting where the plan for the week is decided. During this meeting everyone presents what they did the week before and what they are planning to do the current week.
During the week, other form of meetings can be held by initiation of any of the group members. The person initiating the meeting can decide wether all need to attend or not.

## In case of group disagreements
In case there are disagreements in the group, we will perform a voting where the majority of the group has to agree for the change to take effect.

## Handling workload and illness in the team
If a person in the group does not feel well, he/she should take some rest to make sure it does not get worse.

## In case there is/are some free-rider/s in the team
In the unlikely case of any freeriders we firstly want to talk to the freerider aiming to improve the general situation. If any change does not happen we will involve Andreas or Amanda. If the freerider still doesnâ€™t contribute to the project, the freerider will get kicked out of the group.
